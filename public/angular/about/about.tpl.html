            <p>My name is Jameson, and I am the founder of the Fasting Crusade, your community for Christian Fasting!</p>
            <p>The idea for the Fasting Crusade came to me as I was doing a 24-hour fast with a fellow Christian.  I realized that if I was going to fast with a companion, I wanted a way to interact with him.  What I needed was a way to connect with him so we could inspire and lift each other up.  I was given the idea for a fasting network almost instantly!</p>
            <p>I couldnt stop there.  I wanted more.</p>
            <p>What we need is a spiritual revolution to praise something greater than ourselves.  We want to invite the whole church to join us in this endeavor.  We want to invite you to our Crusade!</p>
            <p>We are here for you because we believe in the Christian Community!</p>
